# excel-in-python
A spreadsheet implemented in Python, using PyScript

Microsoft recently released Python-in-Excel, allowing the use of Python inside Excel spreadsheets. 

In this project, we do the opposite and implement the dependency graph used by spreadsheets like Excel, 
but write everyyhing in Python. This project uses PyScript to display its UI using Python in a browser. 
It contains no JavaScript at all.

This project is not associated with Microsoft. Excel is a registered trademark.
